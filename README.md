# 1-Click Confetti

Confetti Gun in your Menu Bar. Fire it with 1 click.

## Custom emojis & presets

The command now supports Raycast's emoji customization parameter, letting you decide exactly which party emojis to launch.

### Default confetti

Configure the **Default emojis** preference to choose up to six emoji characters that will be used whenever you click the menu bar item or run the no-view command. Leave the field empty to fall back to the built-in celebratory mix. Optionally, set **Default icon** to override the menu bar icon (it falls back to the first emoji otherwise).

### Additional presets

Add more presets via the **Emoji presets** preference. Separate presets with a new line or semicolon, following the format:

```
Name | ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸ¥³ | Optional Icon
```

The icon is optionalâ€”if omitted, the first emoji is used. Give one of your presets pride of place by entering its name in **Default preset name**. That preset will become the default for a quick click, and all presets remain available from the menu bar dropdown (hold âŒ¥ while clicking the icon to keep the menu open and pick a different preset on demand).
